<h2>Pseudo Classes</h2>
<p>I explore various Pseudo-classes and their applications, such as targeting elements based on their states (hover, focus, active, etc.), element hierarchy (first-child, last-child, nth-child, etc.), and even user input (checked, disabled, etc.). By harnessing the power of Pseudo-classes, I can enhance the user experience and create engaging web interfaces.</p>
