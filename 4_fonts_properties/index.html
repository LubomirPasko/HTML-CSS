                    Over the last three decades, Cold Steel has been at the forefront of the many innovations
                    that have helped to define the knife industry. Progressive accomplishment, 
                    including the introduction of the checked Kraton® handles, and the tanto point blade styles
                    have gone from curiously interesting features to industry-wide hallmarks of quality and 
                    sophistication. New ground was also broken with the introduction of unique new blade steels like San Mai III® and Tri-Ad™ 
                    ock & locking mechanism for folding knives. 
                    Tri-Ad™ Lock for example, has never been equaled by any of Cold Steel's competitors and nothing they have produced yet 
                    has been proven to outperform it. Of course Cold Steel will always look to the future, 
                    constantly striving to make the world's strongest, sharpest knives. That goal as elusive and
                    difficult to achieve as it is, has been the same for the past forty years.</p>

                <h2>tri-ad lock</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Cold Steel is perhaps best known for its invention of the Tri-Ad® lock, which they’ve proven through rigorous torture 
                    tests to be the most secure and safest folding knife locking system on the market. Designed by famed knife designer and 
                    Cold Steel collaborator Andrew Demko, the Tri-Ad®lock uses a unique combination of features that responds exceptionally to 
                    both positive and negative pressures and has been tested to hold up to 800 pounds of hanging weights.</p>

                <h2>atlas lock</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="example-four">Cold Steel's all new Atlas® Lock was engineered to blur the lines between folding and fixed blades. 
                    The patent pending Atlas® lock is incredibly durable, reliable, and quick to actuate.
                    The stop pin buffers against and redistributes the force of the blade into the handle and away from the lock bar.
                    The blade is shouldered around the stop pin for increased resistance to wear and tear. 
                    The stop pin buffers against, and redistributes the force pressure from the blade.</p>
                <br>    
                <p class="example-five">The lock bar is compressed between the blade tang and two pins.
                    The force is evenly shared by the two pins creating the strongest lock on the market. The lock bar is positioned along the spine of the handle making it ambidextrous. 
                    The textured release switch sits within a notch in the handle scales keeping it out of the way until 
                    you need to close the blade.</p>
