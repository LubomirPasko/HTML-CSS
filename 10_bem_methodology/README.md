<h2>BEM Methodology</h2>
<p>The BEM methodology is a widely adopted approach for structuring CSS classes and organizing code in a modular and scalable manner. It stands for Block Element Modifier and provides a clear naming convention that helps developers better understand the relationships and dependencies between different components in a project.</p>
<p>By adopting the BEM methodology, I can improve the maintainability and scalability of your CSS code, enhance collaboration within a development team, and streamline the process of styling and extending components in your projects.</p>
